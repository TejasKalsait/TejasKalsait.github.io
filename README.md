### About Me

#### Currently working as a Generative AI Read team analyst @Google (via Vaco) and ex Autonomous Driving Researcher @SUNY Buffalo

As a Generative AI Red Team Analyst at Google (via Vaco), I'm validating and testing the Gemini model and other AI products to ensure their safety and reliability. Previously, I worked as an Autonomous Driving Research Assistant at the State University of New York, where I developed cutting-edge digital twins that replicated real-world scenarios. With a Master's degree in Robotics and Computer Science, I bring a unique combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, which has enabled me to launch two successful generative AI products in the past year. I'm excited to collaborate on innovative projects and explore new ideas, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to build something awesome together, have a job offer for me, or just chat about the latest developments in AI!

Have a project? Want to hire me? or just looking to reach out?
Let's Work Together!
Feel free to reach out if you just want to connect or see if we can build something amazing together.

Thank you.
