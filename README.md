# Looking for full-time opportunities in the US
# Summary
I am a skilled and ambitious graduate student pursuing an MS in Robotics from The State University of New York, Buffalo. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the exciting domains of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Software Development, and Robotics.

My extensive experience includes completing various cutting-edge projects in these fields, such as Image Generation using Deep Convolutional **_Generative Adversarial Network_**, **_Birdâ€™s Eye View for an Autonomous vehicle_**, **_Deployed DeepDream image generator_** as a Python app using Streamlit, **_Path planning algorithm for autonomous vehicles_**, **_Camera Calibration_** using the checkerboard method, **_Object Detection using the YOLO algorithm_**, Face Recognition using Siamese Neural Network, Visual Odometry using Stereo Vision, and many others. Additionally, I have built several **_Deep Reinforcement Learning_** models using **_PyTorch_** to solve complex environments such as Poker, Car Racing, and more. In addition to my numerous successful projects, I have furthered my knowledge by completing over 25 additional courses. At present, I am delving into the intricacies of **_Generative AI_** and **_Transformer Networks_**, fueled by my passion for staying ahead of the curve.

Having devoted five years to mastering my skills in these dynamic domains and implementing numerous successful projects, I am now ready to make a substantial impact on a grander scale. Working full-time at a firm represents the ideal opportunity for me to showcase my talents and achieve even greater success.

Thank you.
